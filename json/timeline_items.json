It is unfair to say that there was any real reply, because the German ships, though they gallantly fought their guns to the last, were hopelessly outnumbered and outgunned, and the nearest thing we had was one German shell which fell some hundred yards short.

Admiral Sturdee in his report says: \"At 4.47 the Gneisenau was hit severely. At 5.8 pm she was evidently in serious straits, and her fire slackened very much. Three ships — Invincible, Inflexible, Carnarvon— were concentrating on her from different bearings. At 5.15 she hit the Invincible; this was her last effective effort.\" \nBy 6 the fight was over and the British collected the survivors who: \n“running over the uppermost side, threw themselves into the water, while the British ships steamed up at full speed to the spot, a few minutes ago the cradle of a proud ship, and now only marked by oil, wreckage, and masses of struggling humanity. Every available boat was lowered, and while the Invincible and Inflexible each picked up 108 and sixty-two survivors respectively, the Carnarvon— who had by now joined up—saved twenty. The survivors included the commander of the Gneisenau and about fifteen officers.” \n“I went away in one of the cutters and succeeded in picking up about forty survivors, most of them in a wounded condition, and all in various stages of exhaustion; and small wonder! for the ship in her last stages must have been a very hell on earth. Anyhow, it was a gruesome business for the rescuers.” \nOf the other ships: \n“…the Glasgow and Cornwall hunted the Leipzig, the Kent chased the Nurnberg, while with the advantages of speed and a good start, the Dresden got clear away. Very different was the fate of the Leipzig and Nurnberg, who were both sunk with colours flying, after a stern chase and gallant resistance”.\n",

While the engine room department was every day acquiring what can only be learned from new engines by careful observation, the torpedo staff and gunnery ratings were busy in their respective duties.” These ships were to be officially called the 13th Flotilla.\n",

Bingham, of Nestor, pressed home their attack on the battle-cruisers and fired two torpedoes at a range of 6,000 and 5,000 yards, being subjected to a heavy fire from the enemy and secondary armament.\n",
