Admiral Sturdee in his report says: \"At 4.47 the Gneisenau was hit severely. At 5.8 pm she was evidently in serious straits, and her fire slackened very much. Three ships \u2014 Invincible, Inflexible, Carnarvon\u2014 were concentrating on her from different bearings. At 5.15 she hit the Invincible; this was her last effective effort.\" \nBy 6 the fight was over and the British collected the survivors who: \n\u201crunning over the uppermost side, threw themselves into the water, while the British ships steamed up at full speed to the spot, a few minutes ago the cradle of a proud ship, and now only marked by oil, wreckage, and masses of struggling humanity. Every available boat was lowered, and while the Invincible and Inflexible each picked up 108 and sixty-two survivors respectively, the Carnarvon\u2014 who had by now joined up\u2014saved twenty. The survivors included the commander of the Gneisenau and about fifteen officers.\u201d \n\u201cI went away in one of the cutters and succeeded in picking up about forty survivors, most of them in a wounded condition, and all in various stages of exhaustion; and small wonder! for the ship in her last stages must have been a very hell on earth. Anyhow, it was a gruesome business for the rescuers.\u201d \nOf the other ships: \n\u201c\u2026the Glasgow and Cornwall hunted the Leipzig, the Kent chased the Nurnberg, while with the advantages of speed and a good start, the Dresden got clear away.
